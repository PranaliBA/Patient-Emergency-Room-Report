Patient Emergency Room Report

Introduction
The Patients Emergency Room Visit Report offers a clear picture of how the emergency room is serving its patients, highlighting who visits, when they come, and how satisfied they are with the care they receive. By exploring patient demographics, appointment types, wait times, and referrals to different departments, the report provides meaningful insights to help improve the overall experience for both patients and staff. The goal is to identify what’s working well and where there’s room for improvement, ultimately ensuring more efficient and patient-focused care.

Analysis
The report reveals that a total of 4,632 patients visited the emergency room, with a near-equal split between administrative (49.35%) and non-administrative (50.65%) appointments. Walk-in patients made up 58.85% of the visits, showing that many patients seek care without prior appointments. Weekdays are much busier than weekends, with 3,300 visits compared to 1,300 on weekends, indicating higher demand during the workweek. Most patients fall into the adult age group (3,550), with middle childhood and teenage groups following behind. It’s also encouraging to see that visits have grown from 2,177 in 2019 to 2,455 in 2020, reflecting the increasing trust in the emergency department’s services.
Looking at referrals, general practice stands out with 924 referrals, followed by orthopedics (469) and physiotherapy (164). However, over 2,700 visits were not associated with any specific referral, which might be an opportunity to streamline how patients are directed to different specialties. The average wait time of 35.53 minutes is manageable, but there’s room to reduce it further to improve patient satisfaction. Interestingly, 75.71% of visits were not rated for satisfaction, which highlights the need to encourage more patients to provide feedback. Among those who did rate their experience, the average satisfaction score was 5.45 out of 10, suggesting there’s work to be done to enhance the patient experience.
The gender breakdown shows an almost even split, with 51.5% female and 48.2% male patients, while 0.3% remain unspecified. A closer look at the heatmap comparing wait times by race and age group highlights some significant differences. These insights can help reduce disparities and ensure everyone gets timely and equal access to care.

Conclusion
This report paints a vivid picture of how the emergency room operates and where attention is needed. The increasing number of visits points to a growing reliance on emergency services, particularly among adults and weekday visitors. Reducing wait times and increasing feedback participation should be a priority, as these factors directly affect patient satisfaction. There’s also a need to review how patients are referred to ensure the right care is provided at the right time. By focusing on these areas, the emergency department can continue improving patient care and provide an even better experience for everyone who walks through its doors.
